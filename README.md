# Optical-Flow

**Dense Optical FLow:** It computes the optical flow vector for every pixel of the frame which may be responsible for its slow speed but leading to a better accurate result. It can be used for detecting motion in the videos, video segmentation, learning structure from motion.

**Lucas-Kanade:** It assumes that the flow is essentially constant in a local neighbourhood of the pixel under consideration, and solves the basic optical flow equations for all the pixels in that neighbourhood, by the least squares criterion.
 
**Horn-Schunck:** It assumes smoothness in the flow over the whole image. Thus, it tries to minimize distortions in flow and prefers solutions which show more smoothness.

**Flow-Net:** FlowNet architecture was introduced in 2015 as the first CNN approach to predict Optical Flow. Authors were inspired by the successful results of CNN architectures in classification, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation tasks. As Deep Learning approaches and CNNs have become a profitable strategy to solve many Computer Vision tasks, authors, in turn, introduced two neural networks for the Optical Flow estimation.
